<p><%= proman %> is an application that helps manage undergraduate final year projects. It provides the following benefits:
<ul>
  <li><em>For supervisors</em>: it provides a convenient on-line method for setting your projects and specifying which disciplines they are suitable for. After allocation, it will provide a convenient link to your students.</li>
  <li><em>For students</em>: it handles the project selection and allocation process. It allows you to browse the projects by discipline, supervisor and research centre; to make a shortlist of the projects that interest you, and to rank these in order of preference. Once your project has been allocated, it <em>Proman<sup>&beta;</sup></em> will provide you with a link to your supervisor, his/her research group and your project coordinator.</li>
  <li><em>For coordinators</em> <%= proman %>  provides a convenient dashboard for accessing information on the projects, supervisors and their students.</li>
</ul>
<p>This project is a <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> application.
It was developed by ICCT student Nicolay Parashkevanov during the academic year 2009-2009.
Nicolay was supervised and this software is now maintained by Dr Chris P. Jobling,
who is the Research Project (EG-353) Coordinator for the School of Engineering,
Swansea University. The software is open source and was developed under the
<a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html">Apache 2 License</a>.
The source code is dual-hosted on <a href="http://code.google.com/p/proman2/">Google code</a>
(in Subversion) and <a href="http://github.com/cpjobling/Proman2/tree/master">Github</a> (in Git).</p>
<p>This is beta-quality software, and as is the tradition in Web2.0, is likely to
remain so! If you wish to help in its development, please
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/proman2/issues/list">report bugs</a>,
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/proman2/w/list">write documentation</a>,
