<p>Please note that this catergorization of projects is approximate as supervisors
may not have been particularly specific in defining the suitability of their projects
for particular disciplines. For example, mechanical engineering projects are often
suitable for product design engineering and project design technology students,
electricial and electronic engineering projects may be suitable for electronics
with computer science and telecommunication engineering.
