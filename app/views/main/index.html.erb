<p><%= proman %> is the new on-line project selection tool that has been
  developed for the School of Engineering to help manage the EG-353 Research Project.
</p>

<% unless logged_in? %>
  <p>Although you can browse the available projects without it, you will need a
    user account and password to access the project selection features of this site. Login details
    have been emailed to all registered staff of the School of Engineering
    and those students expected to be enrolled on the research project EG-353 next year.
    Please contact the project coordinator whose details you will find on the <%= link_to "contact page", :contact, {:target => "_new", :title => "Link to the EG-353 Social Network. Opens in a new window."}  %>
  if you have any difficulties or to request a user account if we have missed you off our lists.</p>
  <p><strong><%= link_to 'Login', login_path %></strong></p>
<% end %>
<% if logged_in?  %>
  <p>From this page you can:</p>
  <ul>

    <%  if current_user.administrator? %>
      <!-- If you are an administrator -->
      <li>Administer <%= proman %>.</li>
    <% end %>
    <% if current_user.coordinator?  %>
      <!-- If you are a coordinator -->
      <li>Coordinate the students, projects and supervisors within your research centre (coming soon).</li>
    <% end %>
    <% if current_user.supervisor? || current_user.student? %>
      <!-- If you are staff -->
      <li>View and amend your <%= link_to "your account details", my_account_path %> details.</li>
    <% end %>
  </ul>
<% end %>
