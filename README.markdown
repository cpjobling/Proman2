# Welcome to Proman

## About this project

__Proman__ is a web application designed to help with the management of undergraduate dissertation projects. It is designed to help with the gathering of project descriptions from academic staff, student selection of projects from the annually published list, allocation of projects to students, and the ongoing management of undergraduate dissertation projects through the academic year. It was created by Nicolay Parashkevanov, a student of Mobile Communications and Internet Technology at Swansea University. __Proman__ is a Ruby on Rails application and hopefully it will be launched as an "endless beta" web application in late May 2009.
